Technology Ideas for Sustainable Forest Management
====================================================

1. REMOTE SENSING & SATELLITE IMAGING
   - Use satellite data to monitor deforestation in real-time
   - Detect illegal logging activities through image analysis

2. DRONES
   - Aerial surveys to assess forest health and coverage
   - Seed planting drones for faster reforestation

3. IoT SENSORS
   - Ground sensors to monitor soil moisture and temperature
   - Early wildfire detection through heat and smoke sensors

4. AI & MACHINE LEARNING
   - Predict areas at high risk of deforestation
   - Analyze biodiversity patterns from camera trap images

5. MOBILE APPS
   - Enable local communities to report illegal activity
   - Crowdsource tree planting and conservation efforts

6. BIG DATA & GIS MAPPING
   - Map forest ecosystems and track changes over time
   - Model carbon sequestration for climate reporting
